# PONY TOWN INFO :

c/h heavily encouraged at any time unless "DNC" in name, im a cuddler, so if u have c/h end in ur name, im likely to come to u lmao
int is okay w me, but beware of some things - I'm a NERD. if u int w me liking any of my fixations, im likely gonna share a LOT of theories / headcanons, in other words I can come off as being obnoxious. forgive me if I also come off as rude, I do not mean ill will, this year i've just not been in a good state of mind.
